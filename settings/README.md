#Notes
## Presets for muted notes (instead of samples)
In the SoundFont preset definition, use the following settings to emulate `abbreviated` and `muted` notes (experimented with pemade):
For both:
- Vol Env Sustain = 144
- Vol Env Release = 0.05
For long muted
- Vol Env Decay = 0.5
For muted:
- Vol Env Decay = 0.1
